## SECOND WEEK ANALYTICTS DATA


Statistics is the study of how data is collected, processed, analyzed, and interpreted to make conclusions or make decisions. In the context of Data Science, statistics have a key role in uncovering patterns, trends, and insights from data.

**Here is a more detailed description of statistics for Data Science:**

1. Data Collection:

Statistics start with data collection. Data can be obtained from various sources, such as surveys, experiments, measurements, or even existing data.

2. Data Description:

Descriptive statistics are used to summarize, describe, and organize data. These include statistical calculations such as mean (average), median (middle value), mode (most frequently appearing value), range, variance, and standard deviation.

3. Data Visualization:

Graphs and visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots are used to represent data graphically. It helps to see the pattern and distribution of data.

4. Probability:

The concept of probability is very important in statistics. This aids in modeling and analysis of data that includes uncertainty. Probability is used in probability theory, probability distribution, and inferential statistics.

5. Inferential Statistics:

Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics used to make conclusions about populations based on data samples. These include hypothesis testing, parameter estimation, and regression analysis.

6. Hypothesis Testing:

In inferential statistics, hypothesis testing is used to test assumptions or claims about populations based on data samples. This involves the creation of hypotheses zero (H0) and alternative hypotheses (H1) as well as statistical testing for decision making.

7. Statistics in Machine Learning:

Statistics play an important role in Machine Learning, such as in model validation, model performance measurement, and feature selection.

8. Decision Making and Policymaking:

The results of statistical analysis are used to make decisions and make policies. Statistics can aid in the identification of business opportunities, quality monitoring, risk analysis, and many other aspects of various industries.



## Hyphotesis Testing  

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to test claims or assumptions made about a population. This is a key step in inferential statistics and is often used to make decisions based on sample data.


**The following is a brief explanation of the hypothesis testing:**

1.	Hypothesis Zero (H0): This is an assumed correct initial hypothesis. It often contains statements that have no effect or difference.

2.	Alternative Hypothesis (H1): This is a hypothesis that seeks to be tested or proved. It can contain statements that there are significant effects or differences.

3.	Data Sample: Data collected from a population or sample representing a population.

4.	Test Statistics: Test statistics (e.g., t-test, chi-square test, z-test) are used to measure the difference between data samples and hypothesis zero.

5.	Significance Level (α): This is an acceptable error rate. The general value is 0.05 or 0.01, indicating the probability of type I error.

6.	Statistical Tests and p-values: The statistical value of the test is calculated and compared to the significance level. If the p-value (probability value) is less than α, then the zero hypothesis is rejected.

7.	Decision: Based on the results of statistical tests and p-values, we decide whether or not we reject hypothesis zero. If the p-value is low, we may reject the zero hypothesis.

8.	Conclusion: Hypothesis testing results are used to make conclusions and make decisions based on empirical data.
