## SECOND WEEK ANALYTICTS DATA


Statistics is the study of how data is collected, processed, analyzed, and interpreted to make conclusions or make decisions. In the context of Data Science, statistics have a key role in uncovering patterns, trends, and insights from data.

**Here is a more detailed description of statistics for Data Science:**

1.	Hypothesis Zero (H0): This is an assumed correct initial hypothesis. It often contains statements that have no effect or difference.

2.	Alternative Hypothesis (H1): This is a hypothesis that seeks to be tested or proved. It can contain statements that there are significant effects or differences.

3.	Data Sample: Data collected from a population or sample representing a population.

4.	Test Statistics: Test statistics (e.g., t-test, chi-square test, z-test) are used to measure the difference between data samples and hypothesis zero.

5.	Significance Level (α): This is an acceptable error rate. The general value is 0.05 or 0.01, indicating the probability of type I error.

6.	Statistical Tests and p-values: The statistical value of the test is calculated and compared to the significance level. If the p-value (probability value) is less than α, then the zero hypothesis is rejected.

7.	Decision: Based on the results of statistical tests and p-values, we decide whether or not we reject hypothesis zero. If the p-value is low, we may reject the zero hypothesis.

8.	Conclusion: Hypothesis testing results are used to make conclusions and make decisions based on empirical data.




## Hyphotesis Testing  

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to test claims or assumptions made about a population. This is a key step in inferential statistics and is often used to make decisions based on sample data.


**The following is a brief explanation of the hypothesis testing:**

1.	Hypothesis Zero (H0): This is an assumed correct initial hypothesis. It often contains statements that have no effect or difference.

2.	Alternative Hypothesis (H1): This is a hypothesis that seeks to be tested or proved. It can contain statements that there are significant effects or differences.

3.	Data Sample: Data collected from a population or sample representing a population.

4.	Test Statistics: Test statistics (e.g., t-test, chi-square test, z-test) are used to measure the difference between data samples and hypothesis zero.

5.	Significance Level (α): This is an acceptable error rate. The general value is 0.05 or 0.01, indicating the probability of type I error.

6.	Statistical Tests and p-values: The statistical value of the test is calculated and compared to the significance level. If the p-value (probability value) is less than α, then the zero hypothesis is rejected.

7.	Decision: Based on the results of statistical tests and p-values, we decide whether or not we reject hypothesis zero. If the p-value is low, we may reject the zero hypothesis.

8.	Conclusion: Hypothesis testing results are used to make conclusions and make decisions based on empirical data.


##  Simple Linear Regression - Machine Learning 

## Simple Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression is a one-technique machine learning greeting used to model the relationship between one independent variable (input) and one dependent variable (output). This is the basis of more complex regression analysis.

Here's a brief explanation of Simple Linear Regression:

1. Independent Variable (X): This is an input variable or predictor. This is the variable used to predict the value of the dependent variable.

2. Dependent variable (Y): This is an output or response variable. These are variables that want to be predicted or modeled based on independent variables.

3. In Simple Linear Regression, we try to model the relationship between X and Y as a straight line (linear model) represented by the regression equation


        Y = β 0 + β1 * X

        Y is a dependent variable.

        X is an independent variable.

        β0 is the intercept (cut point with the Y-axis) of the regression line.

        β1 is the regression coefficient (line slope).


4. Objective: The goal of Linear Regression is to find parameters (β0 and β1) that provide the best regression lines corresponding to the observation data.

5. Model Evaluation: To evaluate the quality of the regression model, we use metrics such as R-squared (determination coefficient) that measure the extent to which the model explains the variation in the data.

6. Linear regression is used in a variety of contexts, including forecasting, economic analysis, social sciences, and other sciences. For example, in a business context, it can be used to predict sales based on advertising costs, or in health sciences, it can be used to predict the relationship between food intake and weight.

7. Limitations: Simple Linear Regression assumes linear relations between independent and dependent variables. It is also susceptible to assumptions of normal distribution and homoscedasticity (homogenicity variance).



## Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a field of computer science that focuses on the development of algorithms and computer models that allow a system to learn and improve its performance from experience and data, without having to be explicitly programmed.


Here's a quick explanation of Machine Learning:

1. Machine Learning involves the ability of a computer to process and analyze data and then use this data to learn and make decisions or predictions.

2. In ML, algorithms and computer models are used to identify important patterns, relationships, and information in data.

3. Machine Learning type:

        • Supervised Learning: The system is provided with training data that pairs with labels, and the goal is to learn the relationship between inputs and                                      outputs so that it can make precise predictions on new data.

        • Unsupervised Learning: The system processes unlabeled data and attempts to find patterns or groups in the data.

        • Reinforcement Learning: The system learns through interaction with its environment and receives feedback based on actions taken.

4. Machine Learning applications: ML is used in a variety of applications, such as facial recognition, text analysis, weather forecasting, fraud alerts, autonomous cars, and more.

5. Evaluation and Model Development: Evaluation of ML models is an important stage in model development. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to measure model performance.
