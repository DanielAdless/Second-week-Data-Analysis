## SECOND WEEK ANALYTICTS DATA


Statistics is the study of how data is collected, processed, analyzed, and interpreted to make conclusions or make decisions. In the context of Data Science, statistics have a key role in uncovering patterns, trends, and insights from data.

**Here is a more detailed description of statistics for Data Science:**

1.	Hypothesis Zero (H0): This is an assumed correct initial hypothesis. It often contains statements that have no effect or difference.

2.	Alternative Hypothesis (H1): This is a hypothesis that seeks to be tested or proved. It can contain statements that there are significant effects or differences.

3.	Data Sample: Data collected from a population or sample representing a population.

4.	Test Statistics: Test statistics (e.g., t-test, chi-square test, z-test) are used to measure the difference between data samples and hypothesis zero.

5.	Significance Level (α): This is an acceptable error rate. The general value is 0.05 or 0.01, indicating the probability of type I error.

6.	Statistical Tests and p-values: The statistical value of the test is calculated and compared to the significance level. If the p-value (probability value) is less than α, then the zero hypothesis is rejected.

7.	Decision: Based on the results of statistical tests and p-values, we decide whether or not we reject hypothesis zero. If the p-value is low, we may reject the zero hypothesis.

8.	Conclusion: Hypothesis testing results are used to make conclusions and make decisions based on empirical data.




## Hyphotesis Testing  

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to test claims or assumptions made about a population. This is a key step in inferential statistics and is often used to make decisions based on sample data.


**The following is a brief explanation of the hypothesis testing:**

1.	Hypothesis Zero (H0): This is an assumed correct initial hypothesis. It often contains statements that have no effect or difference.

2.	Alternative Hypothesis (H1): This is a hypothesis that seeks to be tested or proved. It can contain statements that there are significant effects or differences.

3.	Data Sample: Data collected from a population or sample representing a population.

4.	Test Statistics: Test statistics (e.g., t-test, chi-square test, z-test) are used to measure the difference between data samples and hypothesis zero.

5.	Significance Level (α): This is an acceptable error rate. The general value is 0.05 or 0.01, indicating the probability of type I error.

6.	Statistical Tests and p-values: The statistical value of the test is calculated and compared to the significance level. If the p-value (probability value) is less than α, then the zero hypothesis is rejected.

7.	Decision: Based on the results of statistical tests and p-values, we decide whether or not we reject hypothesis zero. If the p-value is low, we may reject the zero hypothesis.

8.	Conclusion: Hypothesis testing results are used to make conclusions and make decisions based on empirical data.
