## SECOND WEEK ANALYTICTS DATA


Statistics is the study of how data is collected, processed, analyzed, and interpreted to make conclusions or make decisions. In the context of Data Science, statistics have a key role in uncovering patterns, trends, and insights from data.

**Here is a more detailed description of statistics for Data Science:**

1. Data Collection:

Statistics start with data collection. Data can be obtained from various sources, such as surveys, experiments, measurements, or even existing data.

2. Data Description:

Descriptive statistics are used to summarize, describe, and organize data. These include statistical calculations such as mean (average), median (middle value), mode (most frequently appearing value), range, variance, and standard deviation.

3. Data Visualization:

Graphs and visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots are used to represent data graphically. It helps to see the pattern and distribution of data.

4. Probability:

The concept of probability is very important in statistics. This aids in modeling and analysis of data that includes uncertainty. Probability is used in probability theory, probability distribution, and inferential statistics.

5. Inferential Statistics:

Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics used to make conclusions about populations based on data samples. These include hypothesis testing, parameter estimation, and regression analysis.

6. Hypothesis Testing:

In inferential statistics, hypothesis testing is used to test assumptions or claims about populations based on data samples. This involves the creation of hypotheses zero (H0) and alternative hypotheses (H1) as well as statistical testing for decision making.

7. Statistics in Machine Learning:

Statistics play an important role in Machine Learning, such as in model validation, model performance measurement, and feature selection.

8. Decision Making and Policymaking:

The results of statistical analysis are used to make decisions and make policies. Statistics can aid in the identification of business opportunities, quality monitoring, risk analysis, and many other aspects of various industries.
